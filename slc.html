                        <p>has a population of approximately 199,000, was incorporated in 1851.
                            Located in the northern part of the state, it serves as the capital and is the largest city
                            in Utah.
                            As an urban center, Salt Lake City is a hub for culture, business, and transportation in the
                            region.
                            The city’s average income level is 10% higher than the state’s overall average, driven in
                            part by its role
                            as the economic and commercial heart of Utah. Its diverse economy includes sectors like
                            tech, healthcare,
                            and government, attracting professionals and contributing to its relatively higher standard
                            of living.</p>
