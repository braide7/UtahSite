                        <h2>Park City</h2>
                        <p>has a population of around 8,500, is located in the Wasatch Mountains in northern Utah,
                            about 32 miles east of Salt Lake City. Originally founded as a mining town in the 19th
                            century, Park City was
                            incorporated in 1884. Today, the city is known for its world-class ski resorts, including
                            Park City Mountain
                            Resort and Deer Valley, as well as its vibrant arts and cultural scene. While it has an
                            urban core, Park
                            City is generally considered a suburban city due to its small size, affluent population, and
                            proximity to Salt Lake
                            City. The city has a notably higher average income compared to the rest of Utah, driven by
                            its status as a luxury
                            tourist destination, its association with the Sundance Film Festival, and its appeal to
                            high-net-worth residents
                            seeking vacation homes or a second residence. The high cost of living and upscale amenities
                            further reflect its affluent
                            demographic.</p>
